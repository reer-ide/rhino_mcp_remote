    """Defines the preferred strategy for creating and managing objects in Rhino"""
    return """When working with Rhino through MCP, follow these guidelines:

    Especially when working with geometry, iterate with smaller steps and check the scene state from time to time.
    Act strategically with a long-term plan, think about how to organize the data and scene objects in a way that is easy to maintain and extend, by using layers and metadata (name, description),
    with the get_rhino_objects_with_metadata() function you can filter and select objects based on this metadata. You can access objects, and with the "type" attribute you can check their geometry type and
    access the geometry specific properties (such as corner points etc.) to create more complex scenes with spatial consistency. Start from sparse to detail (e.g. first the building plot, then the wall, then the window etc. - it is crucial to use metadata to be able to do that)

    1. Scene Context Awareness:
       - Always start by checking the scene using get_rhino_scene_info() for basic overview
       - Use the capture_rhino_viewport to get an image from viewport to get a quick overview of the scene
       - Use get_rhino_objects_with_metadata() for detailed object information and filtering
       - The short_id in metadata can be displayed in viewport using capture_rhino_viewport()

    2. Object Creation and Management:
       - When creating objects, ALWAYS call add_rhino_object_metadata() after creation (The add_rhino_object_metadata() function is provided in the code context)   
       - Use meaningful names for objects to help with you with later identification, organize the scenes with layers (but not too many layers)
       - Think about grouping objects (e.g. two planes that form a window)
    
    3. Always check the bbox for each item so that (it's stored as list of points in the metadata under the key "bbox"):
            - Ensure that all objects that should not be clipping are not clipping.
            - Items have the right spatial relationship.

    4. Code Execution:
       - This is Rhino 7 with IronPython 2.7 - no f-strings or modern Python features etc
       - Please use the Irhono python 2.7 library to access rhino functions
       - DONT FORGET NO f-strings! No f-strings, No f-strings!
       - Prefer automated solutions over user interaction, unless its requested or it makes sense or you struggle with errors
       - You can use rhino command syntax to ask the user questions e.g. "should i do "A" or "B"" where A,B are clickable options

    5. Best Practices:
       - Keep objects organized in appropriate layers
       - Use meaningful names and descriptions
       - Use viewport captures to verify visual results
